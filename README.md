# Synthesized-Speculation

This repository contains all relevant material to "Decentralizing the Odds: A Peer-to-Peer Alternative to the Money Line", a paper that I am currently working on. In the paper, I express the traditional money line market in terms of an Eisenberg-Gale system, a la "Consensus of Subjective Probabilities: The Parim-Mtuel Method". Having developed this construction, I compare the traditional money line with a novel peer to peer gambling system (designated the Synthesized Speculation system) in terms of both user subjective expectation and sportsbook profit. As evident within the the paper ([Decentralizing the Odds]), the Synthesized Speculation system outperforms the traditional money line across a variety of subjective probability distributions.

## Abstract

Contemporary peer to peer (P2P) betting revolves around betting exchanges, where players place and lay bets in a marketplace supervised by the P2P sportsbook. In this paper, I introduce a novel system of P2P gambling, where the sportsbook takes a more active role in bet creation. Within this system, users submit their subjective probabilities and bet amounts regarding a binary event outcome. Bet amounts are partitioned into slices, which are matched with the slices of other players into peer bets. The stakes, win conditions, and payouts of each peer bet are assigned to provide both players with an equivalent and positive expectation value, according to their corresponding subjective probabilities. Sportsbooks profit by taking a rake from each peer bet pot, in proportion to the amount of subjective expectation created. Residual bet amounts are engaged in an iterative series of money lines, generating additional subjective expectation for the users and additional profit for the sportsbook. This integrated approach, designated the synthesized speculation gambling system, ensures that sportsbook profit is invariant regarding the binary event outcome. My research analyzes the production of user subjective expectation and sportsbook profit through the synthesized speculation system across varying distributions of user subjective probability and betting capacity, in direct competition with the traditional money line. Through this analysis, this paper demonstrates that the synthesized speculation gambling system increases both user subjective expectation and sportsbook profit relative to the traditional money line system. My paper concludes with the recommendation of the synthesized speculation system as a supplement to the traditional money line, as a method of informed speculation for binary events with particular probability spaces.
